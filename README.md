# Canteen Billing System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple Canteen Billing System, developed as my first project after learning the C programming language during my first year of B.Tech. The primary goal of this project is to generate a canteen bill, incorporating fundamental concepts of C programming such as user-defined functions, 2D arrays, loops, and conditional statements.

## Features

- **User-defined Functions**: Modular approach with separate functions for different operations.
- **2D Arrays**: Utilized for storing and managing menu items and prices.
- **Loops**: Employed for iterating through menu options and calculating total costs.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used for decision-making processes within the billing logic.

## Applied Concepts

1. **User-defined Functions**: To ensure modularity and reusability, various functions are created for specific tasks such as displaying the menu, calculating the bill, and processing user input.

2. **2D Arrays**: Used to store the menu items and their respective prices, allowing efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.

3. **Loops**: Implemented to iterate through the menu items and to handle multiple orders, ensuring the program can accommodate various user inputs dynamically.

4. **Conditional Statements**: Applied to facilitate decision-making processes, such as validating user input and determining the final bill based on selected items.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A development environment for C programming (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code)
